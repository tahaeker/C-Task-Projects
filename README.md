# C++ Task Projects
TASKS
Task 1: Create a program that asks the user for a filename. The program should then create a
file with that name and write the text "Hello, World!" into it.
Task 2: Write a function that takes the width and height of a rectangle as user input. The
function should calculate the area of the rectangle, create a file named "rectangle_area.txt",
and write the calculated area into the file.
Task 3: Create an integer array with 5 elements. Write a program that calculates the square of
each element in the array and writes the results to a file named "squares.txt", with each result
on a new line.
Task 4: Develop a program that asks the user for their first name and last name. The program
should then append this information to a file called "names.log". Each new entry (first name
and last name) should be on a new line.
Task 5: Write a program that reads the content from the "sample.txt" file character by
character using the get() function and counts the total number of characters. The program
should then display the total count in the console.
Task 6: Create a program that copies the content of a file named "source.txt" to a new file
named "destination.txt". If "destination.txt" already exists, its content should be overwritten.
Task 7: Write a function that accepts a filename and a string as arguments. The function
should open the specified file and search for all occurrences of the given string, then print the
number of times the string was found to the console.
Task 8: Develop a program that reads numerical data from a file named "numbers.txt"
(assuming one number per line), calculates the average of these numbers, and writes the final
average to a new file named "average.txt".
